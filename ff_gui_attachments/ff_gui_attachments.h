 \brief The header for the ffGuiAttachments module

 \mainpage ffGuiAttachments

 In this module some additions to JUCE (www.juce.com) are provided to attach
 a Slider, ComboBox or RadioButtonGroup to a leaf in a ValueTree.
 This is especially useful to keep GUI components in sync with a ValueTree,
 e.g. th tree behind AudioProcessorValueTreeState. So you can store values
 that are not exposed to the host as parameters.

 \see ValueTreeSliderAttachment, ValueTreeComboBoxAttachment, ValueTreeRadioButtonGroupAttachment, ValueTreeLabelAttachment

 They are used exatly the same as AudioProcessorValueTree::SliderAttachment.
 In the ValueTreeSliderAttachment you can also supply a range for the slider.

 \code{.cpp}
    ValueTree tree = ValueTree ("TestTree");
    ValueTree select = tree.getOrCreateChildWithName ("ComboBox", nullptr);

    // fill ValueTree with some options
    ValueTree option1 = ValueTree ("Option");
    option1.setProperty ("name", "Anything", nullptr);
    select.addChild (option1, 0, nullptr);
    ValueTree option2 = ValueTree ("Option");
    option2.setProperty ("name", "Something", nullptr);
    option2.setProperty ("selected", 1, nullptr);
    select.addChild (option2, 1, nullptr);
    ValueTree option3 = ValueTree ("Option");
    option3.setProperty ("name", "Nothing", nullptr);
    select.addChild (option3, 2, nullptr);

    // simply connect the combobox with the ValueTree
    ComboBox* combo = new ComboBox();
    ValueTreeComboBoxAttachment* comboAttachment = new ValueTreeComboBoxAttachment (select, combo, "name", true);
 \endcode

 Have fun...
 Daniel
